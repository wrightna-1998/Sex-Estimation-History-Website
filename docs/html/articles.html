    <h3 class="article-title">Sex Determination by Discriminant Function Analysis of Crania </h3>
    <h4 class="authors">Eugene Giles and Orville Elliot</h4>
    <p class="summary">Giles and Elliot created and tested discriminant functions from cranial measurements for sex
        determination.
        They had a sample size of 408 skulls of black and white descent with known sex. 300 crania were used to
        create 21 different discriminant functions composed of different combinations of 9 cranial measurements.
        They tested their discriminant functions on the test sample of 108 crania. The tests had an accuracy of
        82-89%.
        Since their sample was based on skeletons with American White and American Black descents, they did
        additional
        tests to identify the accuracy on other ancestral groups and populations. They tested chimpanzee, American
        Indian, and American Irish individuals. With adjusted sectioning points, they had about the same amount of
        accuracy as the initial test population. They concluded that the use of cranial measurements in discriminant
        functions with sectioning points based on the population is a viable method for sex determination.</p>
