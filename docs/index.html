                <dd><b>Sex</b> refers to biological differences. In forensic anthropology, sex is categorized as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>male</li>
                        <li>female</li>
                        or
                        <li>unknown/other</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
                <dd><b>Gender</b> refers to a variety of characteristics that are often correlated with sex by a society</dd>

            <h2 class="homepage-title">Intro</h2>
            <p class="homepage-body">Originally, many methods for sex estimation  of unidentified human remains were developed with bio-archaeological uses in mind. Bio-archaeologists use these methods more often to identify and get demographic information for historic populations, while in forensic anthropology they are used to identify specific individuals, which requires more accuracy. Over the years, more methods have been developed with a focus on the purpose of identifying specific individuals with higher precision and accuracy.</p>

            <p class="homepage-body">The most accurate methods for sex estimation used in forensic anthropology include analysis of postcranial long bones, the os coxa and cranium.</p>

                <div id="homepage-methods-crania">
                    <h3 class="homepage-methods-title">Crania</h3> 
                        <p class="homepage-methods-body">Traditionally, sex estimation of the crania is non-metric in style. These methods often include observing rugosity of muscle attachment sites, and size and shape of various elements. More recently, new methods have been developed using craniometric data. One prominent method was devised by Eugene Giles and Orville Elliot in 1963 involving the use of discriminant function analysis.</p>
                        <p class="homepage-methods-body">They created 21 different discriminant functions using different combinations of 9 of 11 measurements. When they tested their functions, 82-89% were accurately sexed. This method was developed and tested on a sample of crania of American Black and American White descent. If these functions were to be used for individuals of other ancestry groups, Giles and Elliot recommend adjusting the sectioning point for each group.</p>
                        <h4 id="2005-Rogers">2005 Rogers</h4>
                            <p class="body">In 2005, Tracy Rogers did a study on the accuracy of sex estimation from  visual assessment of cranial morphology. Rogers selected 17 traits to be assessed for accuracy. 89.1% of the individuals were accurately sexed using all 17 traits in the assessment. Many of the traits had a high percentage of indeterminate ratings. The analysis suggested traits to be used for sex estimation as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Zygomatic extension, malar size/rugosity, and supraorbital ridge</li>
                                <li>Chin form, and nuchal crest</li>
                                <li>Size of mastoids</li>
                                <li>Nasal size and mandibular symphysis/ramus size</li>
                                <li>Forehead shape</li>
                                <li>Palate size/shape</li>
