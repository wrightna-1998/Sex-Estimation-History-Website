        <p class="summary.body">Originally, many methods for sex estimation  of unidentified human remains were developed with bio-archaeological uses in mind. Bio-archaeologists use these methods more often to identify and get demographic information for historic populations, while in forensic anthropology they are used to identify specific individuals, which requires more accuracy. Over the years, more methods have been developed with a focus on the purpose of identifying specific individuals with higher precision and accuracy.</p>

        <p class="summary.body">The most accurate methods for sex estimation used in forensic anthropology include metric analysis of postcranial long bones, and visual analysis of the os coxa and cranium. Some of the main met</p>
